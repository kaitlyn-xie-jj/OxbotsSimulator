# ⚠️ IMPORTANT — Pause & Reset Before Editing

Webots **automatically starts running the simulation as soon as you open a world**.  

If you edit the scene while the simulation is running, **Webots WILL NOT save your changes**, even if you press `Cmd+Shift+S`.



To avoid losing work:

### ✔ Step 1 — Immediately press **Pause** (⏸)  

### ✔ Step 2 — Then press the **Reset Simulation** button ⏮️:

### ✔ Step 3 — Only after Pause + Reset, you may safely edit the file. 

## ❌ If you forget:

- Webots treats all edits as temporary runtime changes  

- **Closing or resetting the world discards them**

- This comes from many horrible stories 😭

```

All other files are irrelevant to the project and are demos from the software, I kept them just for development reference.

## 3. Running the Simulation

### ✔ Step 1 — Launch Webots  

Open **Webots.app**

### ✔ Step 2 — Open the arena world  

In Webots:

```
file -> Open World
```

Select:

```
worlds/Run.wbt
```

### ✔ You should see:

```
1. The full UniBots arena
	•	A 2 m × 2 m white square floor
	•	Four colored walls:
	•	Yellow (North)
	•	Orange (East)
	•	Green (West)
	•	Purple (South)
	•	Four scoring net structures mounted outside the walls

2. All 40 balls placed in the arena
	•	16 yellow ping-pong balls 
	•	24 steel balls 
	•	Positioned according to the PROTO configuration 
```

## 4. Recommended C++ Build Setup (MacOS - Apple Silicon)

Because Webots resolves controller API symbols at **runtime**, the recommended way to build a C++ controller on macOS (especially Apple Silicon) is to allow the linker to resolve Webots API symbols dynamically:

```
CXX = clang++
CXXFLAGS = -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall

WEBOTS_HOME ?= /Applications/Webots.app

INCLUDE = -I"$(WEBOTS_HOME)/Contents/include/controller/cpp"
LIBDIR  = -L"$(WEBOTS_HOME)/Contents/lib/controller"

# NOTE: Allow runtime symbol resolution for Webots API
LDFLAGS = -Wl,-undefined,dynamic_lookup

TARGET = random_ball_spawner

all:
	$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $(INCLUDE) %file name%.cpp $(LIBDIR) $(LDFLAGS) -o $(TARGET)

clean:
	rm -f $(TARGET)
```
